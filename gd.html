      <h3>What is Graphic Design?</h3>
      <p>Graphic design is a craft where professionals create visual content to communicate messages. By applying
        visual hierarchy and page layout techniques, designers use typography and pictures to meet users’ specific needs
        and focus on the logic of displaying elements in interactive designs, to optimize the user experience.</p>
      <h3>Graphic Design is about Molding the User Experience Visually</h3>
      <p> Graphic design is an ancient craft, dating back past Egyptian hieroglyphs to at least 17,000-year-old cave
        paintings. It’s a term that originated in the 1920s’ print industry. It continues to cover a range of activities
        including logo creation. Graphic design in this sense concerns aesthetic appeal and marketing. Graphic designers
        attract viewers using images, color and typography. However, graphic designers working in user experience (UX)
        design must justify stylistic choices regarding, say, image locations and font with a human-centered approach.
        That means you need to focus on—and seek to empathize the most with—your specific users while you create
        good-looking designs that maximize usability. Aesthetics must serve a purpose—in UX design we don’t create art
        for art’s sake. So, graphic designers must branch into visual design.</p>

      <h3>Graphic Design is Emotional Design</h3>
      <p>Although to work in the digital age means you must design with interactive software, graphic design still
        revolves around age-old principles. It’s crucial that you strike the right chord with users from their first
        glance—hence graphic design’s correspondence with emotional design. As a graphic designer, then, you should have
        a firm understanding of color theory and how vital the right choice of color scheme is. Color choices must
        reflect not only the organization (e.g., blue suits banking) but also users’ expectations (e.g., red for alerts;
        green for notifications to proceed). You should design with an eye for how elements match the tone (e.g.,
        sans-serif fonts for excitement or happiness). You also need to design for the overall effect, and note how you
        shape users’ emotions as you guide them from, for instance, a landing page to a call to action. Often, graphic
        designers are involved in motion design for smaller screens. They will carefully monitor how their works’
        aesthetics match their users’ expectations. They can enhance their designs’ usability in a flowing, seamless
        experience by anticipating the users’ needs and mindsets.</p>
      <h3>Learn more about Graphic Design</h3>
      <p>Have you ever found yourself spotting shapes in the clouds? That is because people are hard-wired to recognize
        patterns, even when there are none. It’s the same reason that we often think we know where to click when first
        experiencing a website—and get frustrated if things aren’t where we think they should be. Choosing the right
        user interface design pattern is crucial to taking advantage of this natural pattern-spotting, and this course
        will teach you how to do just that.</p>
      <p>User interface design patterns are the means by which structure and order can gel together to make powerful
        user experiences. Structure and order are also a user’s best friends, and along with the fact that old habits
        die hard (especially on the web), it is essential that designers consider user interfaces very carefully before
        they set the final design in stone. Products should consist of such good interactions that users don’t even
        notice how they got from point A to point B. Failing to do so can lead to user interfaces that are difficult or
        confusing to navigate, requiring the user to spend an unreasonable amount of time decoding the display—and just
        a few seconds too many can be “unreasonable”—rather than fulfilling their original aims and objectives.</p>
      <p>While the focus is on the practical application of user interface design patterns, by the end of the course you
        will also be familiar with current terminology used in the design of user interfaces, and many of the key
        concepts under discussion. This should help put you ahead of the pack and furnish you with the knowledge
        necessary to advance beyond your competitors.

        So, if you are struggling to decide which user interface design pattern is best, and how you can achieve maximum
        usability through implementing it, then step no further. This course will equip you with the knowledge necessary
        to select the most appropriate display methods and solve common design problems affecting existing user
        interfaces.</p>
